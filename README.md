## Description
Javascript Quiz is exactly what it sounds like, a quiz that tests your knowledge of JavaScript while using Javascript to make this application interactive. The page responds to the start quiz click by dynamically displaying the questions and answers, while iterating through the questions array. A timer keeps track of your time and if you answer incorrectly ten seconds will be taken off your time. Your final score is the total time left. High scores are stored in local storage and can be cleared or called up at any time in the quiz. HTML CSS and Javascript were used to build this page.
